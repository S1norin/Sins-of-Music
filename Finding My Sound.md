# Ditch Premade Presets and Sample
- Everybody uses presets and samples, and actually quite a lot of people use the same resources
	- So instead - try to recreate these presets or samples by yourself. You have all the time in the world and it seems to be a lot of fun. Why would you rob yourself from this joy?
