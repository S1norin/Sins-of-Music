# Major `I` (Tonic)
- A place of rest, peace. There's no need to move to another point
- All chords that need resolution should be resolved to tonic chords
- It is usually only `I`

## Minor `vi` (Alternative Tonic) (Also [[Secondary Dominant]]???)

- Usually a `vi`
- Tend to be a more darker resolution, than `I`

# Major `V` (Dominant)
- Very tense chord, need to be immidealty resolved into `I`
- Can be either `V` or

# Major `IV` (Sub-dominant)
- More relaxed chord than dominant, but still can be tolerated for some time. You can jump from sub-dominant to tonic and be just fine
- Usually a `IV`
## Minor `ii` (Alternative sub-dominant)
- It seems to be that iti is `ii`
- This chord is granted in any diatonic scale, since they're built this way (???)
- It is a minor alternative to a `IV`

# Mix of Tension and Rest
- It is a `iii` chord
- It is given in major scales by default I think
- We would get *resolution* by going to `I`, but we can also *stay* on that chord, though it would be less *satisfactory*


> [!NOTE] Next chords are not given in major scale
> But still quite popular in  of diationic scales

# Flat  `VII`
- Sounds like an `epic, open sound chord`
- Resolves to the tonic

# Flat `III`
- Sound like a blues, since we use a chord from minor scale in major scale

# Flat `VI`
- Indicates a noticable shift

# Flat `II`
- Very distinct sound. Exotic, arabic sound

- Cam be resolved into `IV`
